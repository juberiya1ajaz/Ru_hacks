MindiFy : Revolutionizing Mental Health Education Our inspiration primarily comes from the experiences we've had in our own lives in which we had to face issues in mental health directly.

## How we built itüèóÔ∏è
We built the app primarily on Flask - a Python web micro framework that helps us build web pages that are both performant and stunning!

Finally, we used HTML/CSS/JS and BootStrap to format and write up the web pages you see.


## What's next for MindiFyüí≠

Hopefully, through your support, we can push this app to a lot more people who are just looking for new and interesting things to do during this pandemic, while handling the real issues that lie in mental health.
